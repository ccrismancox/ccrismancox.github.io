Hello!  I am an Assistant Professor at [Texas A&M University](https://liberalarts.tamu.edu/pols/). I received my Ph.D. in political science from the [University of Rochester](https://www.sas.rochester.edu/psc/) in 2016.  My [research](research) focuses on International Relations, Comparative Politics, and Methods, with a focus on interstate disputes, civil conflict, and domestic terrorism. I am particularly interested in fitting and analyzing structural models of conflict.

I can be reached by email at [c.crisman-cox@tamu.edu](mailto:c.crisman-cox@tamu.edu).
